\title{coxfit: Fit Cox Proportional Hazards Model for Survival Data}
\description{
Assuming that the data is sorted in order of increasing survival time, coxfit fits a Cox Proportional Hazards 	model given a design matrix and a censoring vector. It gives equal results to the coxph function of the survival 	package.
}
\details{
The only function you will actually run is fit_cox.
Please refer to the cox_fit documentation for more details and a short example.
